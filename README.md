# Auto-Layout-Frame-vs-Bounds

Download this project and run it in a simulator or an iPhone to understand the subtle, but important differences between Frames and Bounds.

Use the Up, Down, Left, Right arrows to move the Red Box in the respective direction. 
However, to understand the scenarios where frame will be different from bounds, rotate the box using the rotation button.
